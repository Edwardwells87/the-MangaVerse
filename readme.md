# Credits
- I had chat gpt make the filler data for the blogs json 
- also have an image in the assets folder that is from the AI Mid-Journey. I initially planned to do a lot more with the styling but I had such a hard time with my routing that I really just needed to submit. 
- I also leaned heavily on a Coding Bootcamp mini project for structuring.
